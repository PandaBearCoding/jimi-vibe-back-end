# WHY?:
    - My father runs his own small business called, no other than, Jimi Vibe. My father is extremely    passionate about music; having played guitair and various other instruments for the past 50+ years. Jimi Vibe is named after his musical hero, Jimi Hendrix. Jimi Vibe was created in order to acquire musical instruments at a low cost, fix them up, and sell them for profit. 
    - By cutting out third part vendors and building his own website, Jimi Vibe will better buyer experience, increase sales, and decrease costs.
